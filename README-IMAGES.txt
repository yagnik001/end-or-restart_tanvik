HOW TO ADD RADHA KRISHNA IMAGES TO YOUR LANDING PAGE
=====================================================

The page is designed to use multiple Radha Krishna images. Currently, it uses beautiful gradient backgrounds that will show even without images.

TO ADD YOUR OWN IMAGES:

1. Save your Radha Krishna images in the SAME folder as index.html (C:\s folder)

2. Name your images exactly as follows:
   - radha-krishna-bg.jpg (main background image - full page)
   - radha-krishna-bg2.jpg (second background layer)
   - radha-krishna-1.jpg (for decorative elements)

3. Supported image formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp

4. Recommended image sizes:
   - Background images: 1920x1080 or larger
   - Decorative images: Any size (will be cropped to circles)

5. After adding images, refresh your browser (F5) to see them!

CURRENT STATUS:
- Beautiful gradient background is showing (purple, pink, blue colors)
- Once you add images, they will layer on top of the gradients
- All text and functionality remains unchanged

The page will look beautiful with or without images!
